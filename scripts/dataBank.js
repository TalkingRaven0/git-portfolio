    introduction: "Hello! I am Den Arwin Salazar, I have a passion for coding and video games. Which incidentally means that I find development of video games fun. I pride myself in being able to learn and adapt quickly to new information and technologies as long as I have a clear development goal. I aim to enhance my soft skills in terms of cooperation and collaborative coding through working in a professional environment. I am currently on the look out for ways to progress my professional career further and hoping that I could enter the gaming industry as a programmer."
